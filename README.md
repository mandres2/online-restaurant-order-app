# "restaurant application"

<h3>What is this application?</h3>

Simply put, the application is supposed to physiologically behave like an online restaurant ordering system.

## Teams

Project management platform for teams, inspired by [Asana](https://asana.com/) and built using a full JavaScript stack

## Motive
As a Full Stack Developer, the primary motive was to build a full-stack MERN application by utilizing an ORM methodology and establishing a MVC framework. Exerting these types of practices provides an organized/clean environment and allows other developers to maneuver around the code with ease.

### Prerequisites

:black_small_square: IDE: Microsoft Visual Studios 1.40.2 (or higher).
<br>
:black_small_square: Node.js (Version: 12.13.0 or higher)
<br>
:black_small_square: Express - Web application framework designed for building web applications and APIs.
<br>
:black_small_square: Heroku - Container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). Heroku enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
<br>
:black_small_squares: MongoDB/Mongoose

## Deployment

* <b> 'git push origin master' & 'git push heroku master' the files into GitHub Profile and Heroku respectively.</b>
* <b> Link repository and Heroku deployment link to BCS.</b>

## Stack (MERN & Redux)

This project uses the following technologies

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for database (hosted on [mLab](https://mlab.com/)) & [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
- [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) as Node web framework
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org) for client, [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) for routing & [Redux](https://redux.js.org/basics/usagewithreact) for state management
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for server
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) as CSS preprocessor (no CSS frameworks)
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for bootstrapping client

## Quick Start

Get up and running with a development server using the following commands

```javascript
// Install all dependencies for client & server
npm run full-install

// Run client & development server with concurrently
npm run dev

// Assumes Node and npm are installed on machine
// Server runs on http://localhost:5000 (set in server.js) and client on http://localhost:3000 (default for Create React App)
```
